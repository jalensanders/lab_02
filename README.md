## Lab 2
README file for lab 2 respoitory. Contains narrative regarding assignment and other pertinent information and objects.


# Parameters
I decided to focus on the key word "healthcare" for this lab, and what the narrative surrounding the issue of healthcare looked like in differing parts of the country. I decided to choose Seattle, a typically left-leaning city, and Oklahoma City, a more historically right-leaning city. I wanted to use a biffer around 30 miles in order to include areas with a high underrepresented population within the greater Seattle area, like South Seattle and Tacoma.


# Why? 
I wanted to make this comparison to see how the narratives and key words used in conversation about healthcare differed on Twitter in cities with historically different political leanings, hence why I chose Seattle and Oklahoma City, simillarly sized locations on somewhat opposite ends of the political spectrum.


# Similarities and Differences 
For an issue as volatile, important, and emotionally charged as healthcare, I would've expected to see differing results regarding the commentary surrounding it. however, as the word clouds show, there are many more glaring similarities in word choice when talked about on Twitter, with key words like "universal", "co", and "abortion" showing up in both. 


# Results and Improvements
One reasoning for these results could be that people across America more or less agree on the issue of healthcare. Along with this, sample size could play an issue here. I think with more refined research and key words I could've potentially garnered different results. 


# Stand-outs
The main stand out to me is how similar the word clouds are and how many words overlap, especially the most frequent words. Also one thing that subverted my expectations was how quickly the file was able to actually give me my results and get me straight to working on my word cloud. Very streamlined process.
